Generating MIDI music using LSTM model.

I mash up piano pieces by Mozart and Beethoven together into one training set to train an LSTM model. Then I use that LSTM model to generate a sequence of notes/chords to string together into a new piece, hopefully one that incorporates styles of both Mozart and Beethoven.

This project was inspired by this Toward Data Science article by Sigurður Skúli:
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-music-using-a-lstm-neural-network-in-keras-68786834d4c5


The code was borrowed and modified from this Github project:

Code is currently setup to run on Google Colab.
